              <li>Rogue is a fictional superhero appearing in  American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in 
      		            association with the X-Men.</li>
      		  <li>  Rogue, whose real name is Marie D'Ancanto, was an innocent young girl from Meridian..</li>
              <li>She debuted in Avengers Annual  as a top 10 villain, but then soon after joined theX-Men.</li>
              <li>Rogue(anna marie) is part of a subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman 
      		                      abilities. </li>
              <li>Rogue has the involuntary ability to absorb and sometimes also remove the memories, physical 
      		  strength, and superpowers of anyone she touches. Therefore, Rogue considers her powers a curse </li>
              <li>The more Rogue uses her mutant power, the more her mind becomes filled with fragmentary psychic echoes of the people she absorbs.The permanently absorbed Carol Danvers (Ms. Marvel) is a completely distinct, albeit dormant, 
      		  personality in her head, and Mastermind subtly exacerbates Rogue's already severe psychological distress as
      		  a means of revenge against Mystique.</li>
          </ul>
